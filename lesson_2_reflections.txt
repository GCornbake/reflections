What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden file named .git will be created in the same directory, which may contain the configuration and commit history of my work. Initializing a repository is the first step to enable the git funcitons on my project.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is just an intermediate area where the file is added into before a commit is created or before the changes are saved in the repository. I thick it offering the control over the level of which files and which changes the user want to save in a new commit.
